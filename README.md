Real-Time Grammar-Based Syntax Highlighter

This project is a real-time syntax highlighting application developed using Python and PyQt5. It features a custom-built lexical analyzer and parser, providing syntax highlighting functionality without relying on any third-party syntax highlighting libraries.

Project Summary

The application performs lexical analysis and syntax parsing based on a context-free grammar. The graphical user interface updates in real time, highlighting more than five distinct token types as the user types code. This project was developed as part of a programming languages course requirement and follows formal principles of language analysis.

Features

Real-time syntax highlighting while typing
Highlights keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings, comments, and more
Fully custom lexical analyzer (tokenizer)
Custom-built top-down syntax parser
GUI built using PyQt5 and Qt Designer
No use of external syntax-highlighting libraries
Lexical Analysis

The lexical analyzer is implemented using the “State Diagram & Program Implementation” approach. It scans the input text and converts it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, numbers, and comments using regular expressions and state-based logic.

Syntax Analysis

The syntax analyzer uses a top-down parsing approach. It reads the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and checks whether the structure matches the predefined grammar of the language.

Graphical User Interface

The GUI is built with PyQt5 using a .ui layout file created in Qt Designer. The application reacts to every keystroke, applying the appropriate style based on the token type in real time. It provides a clean and interactive way for users to write and analyze code.
